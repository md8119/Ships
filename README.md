Starting with Pygame and building the three windows separately before connecting them is a good approach. Here's a high-level plan to help you get started:

1. **Main Board Window**:
   - Create a Pygame window for the main game board. This is where your game board and pieces will be displayed.
   - Develop the game mechanics, such as player moves, piece interactions, and win/lose conditions, in this window.

2. **Action Window**:
   - Create a second Pygame window for the action window. This window will display game information, buttons, and options for players.
   - Design and implement the user interface for the action window. This might include buttons for starting/restarting the game, displaying scores, or providing game instructions.

3. **Status Window**:
   - Create a third Pygame window for the status window, typically placed at the bottom to show essential information, scores, or messages.
   - Design and implement the user interface for the status window.

4. **Connect the Windows**:
   - Implement a mechanism for communication between these windows. For example, you can use global variables or a game manager class to share data and events between the windows.
   - Ensure that actions in the action window (e.g., clicking a button) can affect the game state in the main board window, and vice versa.
   - Update the status window to display relevant game information.

5. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test each window separately to ensure they function as intended.
   - Test how they interact with each other to create a cohesive gaming experience.
   - Refine and fine-tune the user interfaces, graphics, and gameplay elements.

6. **Full Game Loop**:
   - Integrate the three windows into a single Pygame application with a full game loop.
   - Ensure that the game logic flows smoothly between the main board, action, and status windows.

7. **Graphics and User Experience**:
   - Pay attention to graphics, animations, and user experience (UX) design to make your board game visually appealing and enjoyable.

8. **Testing and Bug Fixing**:
   - Thoroughly test the complete game, addressing any bugs, glitches, or issues that may arise.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Once your board game is fully developed and tested, you can consider deploying it to your chosen platform.

Remember that building a board game with multiple windows can be complex, so take it step by step and gradually integrate the different components. You might also find it helpful to use an object-oriented design approach to manage various game elements and interactions effectively. Good luck with your Pygame board game project!
